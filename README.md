# Api-Learning

I wanted to make this project to learn more about APIs. I have learned alot with this one, even though the code is poop
I'm happy with the results.
This code is able to """fastly""" copy the Fipe's database. <br>
There are a lot of bugs and the code is not documented so I don't recommend using this repository.
